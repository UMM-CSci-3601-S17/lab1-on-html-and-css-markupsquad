        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>D&infin; Dice exists to serve the needs of dice users in whatever forms you may find them.
        Whether their a family playing Yahtzee, a group of college students playing Dungeons & Dragons,
         or even a professional casino d&infin; Dice is here for you. Our guarentee is that our dice are
         perfectly balanced and tested with 1000+ rolls prior to sale, they also look fantastic. If your
        friends aren't impressed by your ability to generate random numbers with archaic physical devices
        far inferior to modern computational devices in balance, options, and portability you can get your
        money back, no questions asked.</p>
